Examples
========


Holland default
---------------

1D, surfbeat, random normal incident waves.Aim: Dune erosion

This test simulates dune erosion on the standard Holland profile (DUROS) under normative conditions. Simple exampe with minimal input.

Field experiment: DELILAH
-------------------------

2D, surfbeat, directional spreading. Aim: comparison field data hydrodynamics

In order to verify the 2DH hydrodynamics of XBeach when forced by directionally-spread
short waves, a simulation is set up to compare model results to field measurements. In this
case the DELILAH field experiment at Duck, North Carolina is selected as a suitable test
location. The period that is modeled is October 13th 1990, which was a stormy day, between
16:00 and 17:00 hours.

Longcrested Refraction
----------------------

2D, surfbeat, random long crested incident waves, hydrodynamics only. Aim: simulation of refraction

Longcrested waves are supported in XBeach by using a value s larger than 1,000. This test shows the numerical directional diffusion in the comparison of a few runs where the angle of wave incidence and the number of directional bins vary. The bathymetry is a linear sloping beach and no morphological change is computed in these runs.

Hurricane Sandy
---------------

2D, surfbeat, nested in SWAN simulation. Aim: beach and dune erosion

This model setup is used as a tool to model the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the New Jersey coast. Hurricane Sandy caused wide-spread erosion of the coastal system as well as barrier island breaching at several spots. The model focusses on the area of Camp Osborne, Brick, NJ where a condominium resulted in 32% additional erosion in adjacent locations.

Port application
----------------------

2D, surfbeat, random incident waves, hydrodynamics only. Aim: simulation of port hydrodynamics

The laboratory experiments were conducted at Deltares in the Vinj√® directional basin in 2004. The tests were carried out under controlled
conditions for the purpose of validating new numerical models of wave forces on moored ships (van der Molen, 2006). In this study, the dataset is only used to examine the computational skills of XBeach in a harbour basin by comparing the measured and calculated results of the hydrodynamics. Wave forces are not considered in this study
